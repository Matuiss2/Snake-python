# Snake-python
Small, snake game in python that i ll improve sporadically 

V 1.0 - functional game

V 1.06 - Improves the readability, improves slightly the performance

V 1.08 - Adds some sfx(eating and game over)

V 1.2 - Adds background music, removes the score on the top left(just showing it at the end)

V 1.23 - The music now loops

V 1.26 - Adds menu skeleton, changes the background color to light gray to avoid confusion with the taskbar

V 1.32 - Changed the variable name fps to speed to avoid confusion, few performance improvements(direction, sounds)

V 1.38 - Performance boost by changing most of the lists to deque, O(1) vs the previous O(n)

todo - Complete menu skeleton, add difficult settings, add another music options, add buttons, making the path to the songs relative( Im still failing at that)
